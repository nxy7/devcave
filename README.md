Passionate fullstack webdev that likes trying out new things.
Huge Rust/Golang fan, although I'm fine using typescript too ❤️

## Portfolio
my portfolio is still work in progress and you can see it at https://nxy7.github.io/

## Dotfiles
I'm storing configuration I use for new systems in github repo: https://github.com/nxy7/dotfiles
My main goal here is to have easily reproducible systems with nix + home-manager, which allows me to
spin up new machines and have them set up as my main one really easily.
